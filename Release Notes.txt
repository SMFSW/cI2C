Arduino Hardware I2C for AVR (plain c)
2017-2017 SMFSW

- cI2C is set to work on AVR targets only
	-> for other targets, you may use WireWrapper instead (will be using Wire)
	-> cI2C & WireWrapper libs declare same structures & functions as seen from the outside
		(switch between libs without changing anyhting but the include)
